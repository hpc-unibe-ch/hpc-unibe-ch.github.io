# ParaView

This article describes the steps to launch a ParaView Server on UBELIX compute nodes and connect a local ParaView client with it.

## Prerequisites

The local (on your local machine) ParaView version need to match the version loaded on UBELIX.

## Launch ParaView server

First, as mentioned, establish a SSH session with *Port forwarding*, another port in the range [2000-65000] should be selected: 

```Bash
ssh -Y -L 15051:localhost:15051 submit03.unibe.ch
```

Then load the modules:

```Bash
module load ParaView
```

The ParaView version can be displayed using:

```Bash
module list ParaView

Currently Loaded Modules Matching: ParaView
  1) ParaView/5.8.1-foss-2020b-mpi
```

Thus, in this example ParaView 5.8.1 need to be used in the local machine. 

To start the ParaView server on a compute node you can use:

```Bash
pvserver-parallel 15051   ### use your selected port number
```

This submits a job with `1 core` for `1h` in the `epyc2` partition. 
The tool prints a reminder to stop the job if not required anymore and shows the queueing information regularly:

```Bash
ParaView remote Server submitted to compute nodes
  when finished please kill the server using:
     scancel 2394231
job 2394231 status:
   JOBID  PARTITION    STATE               START_TIME
 2394231      epyc2  PENDING                      N/A
pvserver ready to connect on port 15051.
When finished, please stop ParaView Server using
 scancel 2394231
```


!!! type note ""
    Please cancel your job with `scancel $JOBID` or all your running jobs using `scancel -u $USER` if not needed anymore. 

Additional resources can be requested by `--slurm-args=""` option with the desired slurm options, e.g. `3 cores` for `20 min`:

```Bash
pvserver-parallel 15051 --slurm-args="--cpus-per-task=3 --time=00:20:00" 
```

In addition ParaView arguments can be added without any prefix. 

## Connect local client
Finally, the client on your local machine can connect using `localhost` and the selected port, here `15051`. E.g. using `pvpython`:

```Bash
pvpython
