**Q: Will there be a possibility to cap my bill?**
A: Yes. We will provide a possibility to set-up a price-limit per project. This limit will be evaluated before starting a job. Also, cost-intensive jobs will print a warning-message on submit. Please note that the cost ceiling cannot be guaranteed in all cases, as simultaneous job submissions may cause one job to start before the other is recorded, potentially exceeding the limit.

A: We will send out bills **monthly**.
