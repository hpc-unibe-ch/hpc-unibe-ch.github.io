# Free tiers
To allow users without project-funding or with small tasks to run jobs on UBELIX for free, we developed three free tiers on UBELIX:

# F1 - User
The following resources are always available free of charge:
- CPU: 1152 TRES run minutes
- 2 GPUs (RTX 4090) – 16 cards in pool
- 1 GPU (H100) – 8 cards in pool

# F2 - Research Group / Project
Each research group receives a credit of CHF 1000 per year. The deduction is applied at the end of the fiscal year. We will refund up to CHF 1000.- via internal transfer ("Umbuchung").

# F3 - Preemptable
Invested resources can be used free of charge if the investor is not using them.
Checkpointing is highly recommended!
