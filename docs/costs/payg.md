# Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) Scheme

## Overview
The PAYG model offers flexible, usage-based billing for UBELIX HPC resources. Ideal for sporadic or variable workloads, costs are calculated per minute, with no long-term commitments.

## Pricing Structure
The Pricing can be found here. Link is only accessible internally or when in UniBE-VPN.

**Notes:**
- Billing is per-minute; debug/preemptable jobs are **free**.
- CPU/memory costs use `max(cpu, mem)`.

## Free Tiers
