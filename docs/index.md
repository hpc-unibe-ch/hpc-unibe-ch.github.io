# Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of the University of Bern

## Introduction

Official documentation site of the high performance computing and the HPC
cluster UBELIX.

Currently, the UBELIX cluster runs around 320 compute nodes featuring ~12k CPU
cores and 160 GPUs with almost one million GPU cores. The infrastructure is
available to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can
also be used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course.

If your campus account is not yet activated for UBELIX, the [Getting Started Guide](quick-start.md)
might be a good place to get you started.

UBELIX features a plethora of software and applications, which is outlined on
the page Software, but the users are free to compile and install their own
software within their home directories.

If you are wondering... UBELIX is an acronym and stands for **U**niversity of
**Be**rn **Li**nu**x** Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely
coincidental and not intended in any way).

    See what is currently running on UBELIX on the [Job Monitoring](https://www.ubelix.unibe.ch/xmlqstat/) pages.

## Acknowledging UBELIX

When you present results generated using our cluster UBELIX, we kindly ask you
to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you
could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the
UBELIX cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are
important for us to ensure long-term funding of UBELIX.

Whenever the UBELIX infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a
publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the
acknowledgements:

    "Calculations were performed on UBELIX (http://www.id.unibe.ch/hpc), the HPC cluster at the University of Bern."

## Press Kit
Occasionally we are asked for images like diagrams illustrating the structure of UBELIX or even pictures of machines/storage or the like. Often this is due to the need to describe UBELIX within a research proposal. To support you with this, we provide a short text about UBELIX and some files to download. You can use all of this within your research proposal.
