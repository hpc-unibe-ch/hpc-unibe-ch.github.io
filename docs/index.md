# Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of the University of Bern

## Introduction

Official documentation site of the high performance computing and the HPC
cluster UBELIX.

Currently, the UBELIX cluster runs around 280 compute nodes featuring ~15k CPU
cores and ~180 GPUs with almost one million GPU cores. The infrastructure is
available to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can
also be used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course.

If you are wondering... UBELIX is an acronym and stands for **U**niversity of
**Be**rn **Li**nu**x** Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely
coincidental and not intended in any way).

## Acknowledging UBELIX

When you present results generated using our cluster UBELIX, we kindly ask you
to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you
could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the
UBELIX cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are
important for us to ensure long-term funding of UBELIX.

Whenever the UBELIX infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a
publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the
acknowledgements:

    "Calculations were performed on UBELIX (https://www.id.unibe.ch/hpc), the HPC cluster at the University of Bern."
