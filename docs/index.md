    !!! danger "COVID-19 Pandemic: impact on UBELIX operations"
     The University of Bern switched to emergency operations (minimal presence). The HPC team put in all effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 by working remotly.

     The UBELIX system stays in production and the HPC team do their best to continue the services, even if problems may take longer to solve. For any questions or issue please write to: [hpc@id.unibe.ch](mailto:hpc@id.unibe.ch)

     The UniBE HPC team would like to contribute to the research in the fight against COVID-19. Any related studies may get special UBELIX priorities as well as special software support on request ([hpc@id.unibe.ch](mailto:hpc@id.unibe.ch)).

# Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of the University of Bern

## Introduction

Official documentation site of the high performance computing and the HPC
cluster UBELIX.

Currently, the UBELIX cluster runs about 330 compute nodes featuring almost
6'300 CPU cores and about 300'000 GPU cores. The infrastructure is available
to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can also be
used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course.

If your campus account is not yet activated for UBELIX, the [Getting Started Guide](quick-start.md)
might be a good place to get you started.

UBELIX features a plethora of software and applications, which is outlined on
the page Software, but the users are free to compile and install their own
software within their home directories.

If you are wondering... UBELIX is an acronym and stands for **U**niversity of
**Be**rn **Li**nu**x** Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely
coincidental and not intended in any way).

!!! note "Job Monitoroing"
    See what is currently running on UBELIX on the [Job Monitoring](https://www.ubelix.unibe.ch/xmlqstat/) pages.

## Acknowledging UBELIX

When you present results generated using our cluster UBELIX, we kindly ask you
to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you
could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the
UBELIX cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are
important for us to ensure long-term funding of UBELIX.

Whenever the UBELIX infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a
publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the
acknowledgements:

    "Calculations were performed on UBELIX (http://www.id.unibe.ch/hpc), the HPC cluster at the University of Bern."

## Press Kit
Occasionally we are asked for images like diagrams illustrating the structure of UBELIX or even pictures of machines/storage or the like. Often this is due to the need to describe UBELIX within a research proposal. To support you with this, we provide a short text about UBELIX and some files to download. You can use all of this within your research proposal.

COMING SOON IN 2020
