# Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of the University of Bern

!!! warning "Changes to UBELIX usage model in December 2025"
    The University of Bern has introduced a **pricing scheme** for its High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster UBELIX.
    This change aims to make the system fair, sustainable, and transparent — ensuring that resources are used efficiently, while keeping UBELIX accessible to all members of the University of Bern. [Read more.](costs/overview.md)

## Introduction

Official documentation site of the high performance computing and the HPC
cluster UBELIX.

Currently, the UBELIX cluster runs around 280 compute nodes featuring ~15k CPU
cores and ~180 GPUs with almost one million GPU cores. The infrastructure is
available to all University personnel for their scientific work. The cluster can
also be used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course.

If you are wondering... UBELIX is an acronym and stands for **U**niversity of
**Be**rn **Li**nu**x** Cluster (Naming similarities to known Gauls are purely
coincidental and not intended in any way).
