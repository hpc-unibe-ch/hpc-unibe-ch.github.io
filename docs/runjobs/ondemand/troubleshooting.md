# Troubleshooting OnDemand

## Common problems

## General information for troubleshooting OnDemand

Logs and scripts for each interactive session with Open OnDemand are stored in:

```
~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys
```

There are directories for each interactive app type within this directory. For example, to see the scripts and logs for an RStudio session, you might look at the files under:

```
~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/rstudio/output/b5733507-a750-4bb9-8d4b-710618ce0de1
```

where `b5733507-a750-4bb9-8d4b-710618ce0de1` corresponds to a specific session of an OOD app (the RStudio app in this case).
