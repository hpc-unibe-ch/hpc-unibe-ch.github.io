# Fair Share

## Description

The provided resources of UBELIX are meant to be provided in a fair fashion between all cluster users. Every participating user is entitled for the same amount of resources. Fair-share is the largest factor in determining priority, but not the only one.

The fair-share system is designed to encourage users to balance their use of resources over time and de-prioritize users/accounts with above average usage.

## Fair Share Score
Compared to a baseline, users and projects can use their fair share of resources slowly or fast for a given period. This rate is represented through the Fair Share score. The Fair Share score is a number between 0 and 1.

Generally, users and projects with a **larger** Fair Share score will receive a **higher priority** in the queue.

- Using your share **faster** than your **expected rate of usage** will usually cause your Fair Share score to **decrease**. The more extreme the overuse, the more severe the likely drop.
- Using your share **slower** than your **expected rate of usage** will usually cause your Fair Share score to **increase**. The more extreme the underuse, the greater the Fair Share bonus.
- Using the cluster **unevenly** will cause your Fair Share score to **decrease**.
