# Teaching with UBELIX

If you plan to use UBELIX for teaching in scheduled courses, we highly recommend that reach out to us for the following reasons:

- When possible, we can plan our maintenance sessions outside of your planned teaching / training dates.
- We can help with the reservation of computing resources so that they are reserved for your course and available the day of your teaching or training session.
- For hands-on sessions involving UBELIX, every student or trainee needs an active
UBELIX account. If we know the list of participants ahead of time, we can already activate the
accounts for all participants without the need for every person to register on
the first day of the course.

Please contact the [UBELIX team][support] to help you in the preparation of your teaching / training session.
