To follow the example, you need the following packages installed, and the corresponding libraries loaded:</p> <pre><code>&gt; library(doParallel)\n&gt; library(foreach)\n</code></pre> <p>The foreach package provides a looping construct for executing R statements repeatedly, either sequentially (similar to a for loop) or in parallel. While the binary operator %do% is used for executing the statements sequentially, the %dopar% operator is used to execute code in parallel using the currently registered backend. The getDoParWorkers() function returns the number of execution workers (cores) available in the currently registered doPar backend, by default this corresponds to one worker:</p> <pre><code>&gt; getDoParWorkers()\n[1] 1\n</code></pre> <p>Hence, the following R code will execute on a single core (even with the %dopar% operator):</p> <pre><code>&gt; start.time &lt;- Sys.time()\n&gt; foreach(i=4:1, .combine='c', .inorder=FALSE) %dopar% {\n+ Sys.sleep(3*i)\n+ i\n+ }\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nexec.time &lt;- end.time - start.time\n[1] 4 3 2 1\n</code></pre> <p>Let\u2019s measure the runtime of the sequentiall execution:</p> <pre><code>&gt; start.time &lt;- Sys.time(); foreach(i=4:1, .combine='c', .inorder=TRUE) %dopar% { Sys.sleep(3*i); i }; end.time &lt;- Sys.time(); exec.time &lt;- end.time - start.time; exec.time\n[1] 4 3 2 1\nTime difference of 30.04088 secs\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we will register a parallel backend to allow the %dopar% operator to execute in parallel. The doParallel package provides a parallel backend for the %dopar% operator. Let\u2019s find out the number of cores available on the current node</p> <pre><code>&gt; system('nproc')\n[1] 24\n</code></pre> <p>To register the doPar backend call the function registerDoParallel().

Typically, workspace storage is used to store project data, share applications and libraries compiled for the project. Workspaces are located under <code>/storage/research</code> and <code>/storage/workspaces</code>. The space in each workspace is controlled individually by the quota of the corresponding research storage share. Similar to user home directories, workspaces are protected by regular snapshots to recover accidentally modified or deleted data.</p> <p>Workspace storage is based on the Research Storage service.</p> <p>Capacity storage is intended to store large amounts of reproducible research data amongst the members of a project. Projects are located under <code>/storage/capacicty</code> and only accessible through the <code>submit</code> nodes. The space in each project is controlled individually by the quota of the corresponding capacity storage share. In contrast to workspaces, data is NOT protected by regular snapshots to recover accidentally modified or deleted data.</p> <p>Capacity storage is based on the Capacity Storage service.</p> <p>SCRATCH (<code>/storage/scratch</code>) is a temporary space with less restrictive limitations in size, but more restrictive limitation in time.
